# RosalindPy
This project is for solving http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ challenges. Each folder is named after the ID of each problem in the listview. 

Each folder contains a script, an input file and an output file. 

The script will be run against the input file and the output will always be stored in a output.txt file. 

utils contains utilities that are shared amongst different projects.
